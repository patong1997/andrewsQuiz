# andrewsQuiz
This is my first android app. It's just a small quiz program I wrote mostly for learning purposes only. 
I wanted to learn how to design a U.I and use C++ code in an Android app. It definitely
made things more dificult than if I had just coded it in Java, but I want to turn another program I've already 
written in C++ into an android app so I used this program to learn the wrapping process.
